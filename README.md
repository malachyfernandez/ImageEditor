## ‚ú® Key Features

This project combines a robust set of standard photo editing tools with cutting-edge AI functionality.

### Core Editing Workflow

  * **Layer-Based System**: Add, delete, rename, and reorder layers for complex compositions. The base image acts as the background.
  * **Non-Destructive Adjustments**: Tweak brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, and blur for any selected layer or for the base image independently.
  * **Transform Tools**: Easily move and scale layers directly on the canvas with interactive handles.
  * **Masking & Blending**: Apply corner rounding and feathering to layers. Choose from 16 different blend modes (Multiply, Screen, Overlay, etc.) to control how layers interact.
  * **Cropping**: A simple and intuitive crop tool for trimming individual layers.
  * **HEIC Support**: Automatically converts and handles `.heic` and `.heif` image files from Apple devices.

### ü§ñ Gemini-Powered AI Editing

  * **In-painting and Out-painting**: Select any layer (or the base image) and use a simple text prompt to completely transform it.
  * **Creative Generation**: Change backgrounds, alter objects, modify styles, or generate entirely new elements within a layer. For example, select a layer with a person and prompt "make them wear a superhero costume."
  * **Smart Feathering**: AI-edited layers automatically have a subtle feather applied to help them blend more naturally into the composition.

### User Experience

  * **Full Undo/Redo**: Complete history tracking allows you to step backward and forward through every action.
  * **Persistent Settings**: Your Gemini API key and default panel layouts are saved in your browser's local storage.
  * **Drag & Drop**: Add new images by simply dragging them onto the window from your desktop.
  * **Helpful UI**: Toast notifications provide feedback on actions, and a loading overlay indicates when the AI is working.
  * **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Boost your productivity with intuitive hotkeys for common actions.

2.  **Upload a Base Image**: Drag and drop an image file onto the window, or use the "Choose File" button.
3.  **Add More Layers**: Once the base image is loaded, you can add more images as new layers on top.
4.  **Select & Edit**: Click on any layer in the right-hand panel (or the base image) to select it.
5.  **Adjust**: Use the "Adjustments" and "Masking" panels in the sidebar to modify the selected layer.
6.  **Transform**: Click and drag a layer on the canvas to move it. Drag the corner handles to scale it.
7.  **Use AI Edit**:
      * First, go to **Settings (‚öôÔ∏è icon)** and enter your Google Gemini API key.
      * Select a layer and click the **AI Edit** button.
      * Enter a prompt describing the change you want (e.g., "change the background to a snowy forest") and press **Generate**.
8.  **Download**: Click "Download Image" to save the final composition as a PNG file, or use the "Download" button in the layer panel to save just the selected layer.
